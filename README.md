A 2D Top Down Multiplayer Tactical Team Shooter Game

Idea
----

I am trying to create an environment different to that of Call of Duty and Battlefield 3. (Not in the 2D/3D sense)
In thease games, players run around chaotically and work by themselves to increase their stats. This game
will focus on encouraging team cooperation by introducing aspects such as permadeath and physical game play
being effected by team member deaths.

* The game tries to trigger an emotional response in the player in a number of ways
  * By having the death of your team mates effect the gameplay by manipulating both the graphics and audio
  * By having game modes where there is an option other than extermination of enemy team members to achieve victory

* The game encourages team cooperation, it almost makes it a necessity  

Inspiration
-----------

* The graphics style is inspired by the game Frozen Synaps (although the gameplay is completely different).
* I am very interested in making games that trigger strong emotional responses in players.
